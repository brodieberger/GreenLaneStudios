                    The clients will be able to view available marina spaces, make reservations, manage boat and personal information, check weather forecasts and tide charts, and make online payments for boat storage or marina services. On the staff side, the system allows employees to manage slip assignments, access customer information, track inventory and supplies, and assign maintenance tasks. Our software will allow users to access all relevant information and work with the marina without having to call over the phone or ask questions in person. The employees will benefit as well, with many aspects of their job simplified and made more efficient.

                    Our piece of software is designed to streamline the operations of Hawk Island Marina by transitioning the workflow from being primarily paper based to an efficient, web based platform. The system’s primary purpose is to manage the marina's operations and provide users (customers, staff, and administrators) with convenient tools to access and manage marina related services.
